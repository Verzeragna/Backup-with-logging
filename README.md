# Backup-with-logging  
The principle of operation is the same as in https://github.com/Verzeragna/Backup  
Here I applied the acquired knowledge of AOP to log the operation of the application. In particular, I used the Aspect class and PointCut expression. The log4j library is used for logging. You will find all information about connected dependencies in the pom.xml file.
